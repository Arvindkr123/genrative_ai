<h1>Welcome to Generative AI</h1>

<p>This repository covers key concepts of Generative AI and how to use them effectively.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Prompt Engineering</strong>  
    <p>Designing and refining prompts to guide the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) for accurate and desired outputs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>LLM Settings</strong>  
    <p>Configuration options such as temperature, max tokens, and system prompts that influence the style, randomness, and length of responses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Structured Output</strong>  
    <p>Techniques to format model responses into specific structures such as JSON, tables, or key-value pairs for better integration with applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tool Calling</strong>  
    <p>Used to interact with external resources, such as APIs, databases, and other tools, enabling the LLM to extend beyond text generation.</p>
